Coconut Cake Recipes,"This is a super moist and tasty coconut cake. Growing up in Brazil, this was a favorite amongst our circle of friends. It is especially good with a cup of coffee on the side. I've converted a few of my anti-coconut family and friends into lovers of this cake. Enjoy it plain, or dress it up with your favorite glaze or frosting and toasted coconut.",4.8,1 hrs,true
